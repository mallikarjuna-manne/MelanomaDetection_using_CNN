## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Data set contains the data of following diseases:
	Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis, Squamous cell carcinoma, Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- Model3 was given the best accuracy.
- After data augmentation accuracy of the model was increased.
- The best validation accuarcy of the model is 0.8263 which occured at 25th epoch with train accuracy of 0.9388.
